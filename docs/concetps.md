# Concepts

The key elements of conversational search: question understanding, conversation flow, retrieval & reranking, answer generation and related question suggestions. 

## chat history

build a specialized store with a simple CRUD API managing the resources: memories, question/answer messages, summaries, et al.

## query rewriting

## retrieval

usually search across multiple sources (e.g., the web + vertical indexes) and chat history, rerank the result and send it as context to the LLM. 

* search the web - via APIs or metasearch like searxng
* retrieve self-hosted indexes - via vearch or other vector/hybrid search systems

## reranking

## answer generation

## question suggestions

also generated by the LLM

## multi-step reasoning

## planning
