# Overall design

The key elements of conversational search: question understanding, conversation flow, and answer generation. 

Laiwen is implemented with LLMs, chat history, and RAG.

## chat history

build a specialized store with a simple CRUD API managing the resources: memories, question/answer messages, summaries, et al.

## retrieval augmented generation

search across multiple sources (the web + vertical indexes) and chat history, and send the result as context to the LLM. 

* search the web - via APIs or metasearch like searxng
* retrieve self-hosted indexes - via vearch or other vector/hybrid search systems

## multi-LLM support

invoke multiple open-source models or RESTful APIs, via ollama

## question suggestions

generated by the LLM

## search agents
